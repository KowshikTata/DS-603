NoSQL Databases
The word NoSQL refers to the not only SQL databases which means there are other database systems other than relational database systems. It was first coined in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi. It got a new meaning after 2009 when Johan Oskarsson discussed about open source databases.
Under NoSQL there are various data models like

A key-value database is a type of nonrelational database that uses a simple key-value method to store data without any relation unlike relational database systems consisting of rows and columns
Document Databases store data in form of documents, they are a type of key-value databases where document consists of many key value pairs and document itself serves as a value. It is similar to JSON, XML.
Graph Databases can be seen as another form of Document databases involving a relationship. Graph databases consists of node, property and edge.
Columnar databases store data in columns. Columnar databases are very useful to read data more efficiently and return queries with greater speed.
Data Lake house
                  

Data Lakehouse can be seen as merging of Data Warehouse and Data Lake involving a meta and governance layer.
Data lake houses are extension of data warehouse. Merging them together into a single system eases data flow and teams can access data faster as they can handle data connecting to one system instead of various servers.
